When using LangChain with a local LLM (like Llama2 via Ollama), the orchestration becomes even smarter:

1. [cyan]Intelligent Tool Selection[/cyan]
   The LLM decides which models to use based on email characteristics

2. [cyan]Contextual Analysis[/cyan]
   The LLM understands the email content and can reason about it

3. [cyan]Adaptive Strategy[/cyan]
   If models disagree, the LLM can request additional analysis

4. [cyan]Natural Language Explanation[/cyan]
   The LLM provides human-readable explanations of its decision

5. [cyan]Pattern Recognition[/cyan]
   The LLM can identify new phishing patterns not in training data

Example LLM reasoning:
"I notice this email mentions cryptocurrency rewards and uses urgency tactics.
Let me check with the Neural Network and Logistic Regression models first,
as they're best at detecting crypto scams. The models show high spam probability
(97.8% and 100%). The suspicious domain and future date confirm this is phishing."
