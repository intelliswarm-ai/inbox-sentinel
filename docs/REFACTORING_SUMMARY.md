# Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

The Inbox Sentinel project has been refactored to follow professional Python engineering best practices. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Clean Package Structure**
- Created a proper Python package structure with `inbox_sentinel/` as the main package
- Organized code into logical modules: `core`, `ml`, `servers`, `config`, `utils`, `scripts`
- Added proper `__init__.py` files for clean imports

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- **core/**: Base classes, types, constants, and exceptions
- **ml/**: Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **servers/**: MCP server implementations
- **config/**: Centralized configuration with Pydantic

### 3. **Professional Project Setup**
- `pyproject.toml`: Modern Python project configuration
- `setup.py`: Package installation support
- `Makefile`: Common development tasks
- `.gitignore`: Comprehensive ignore patterns
- `.env.example`: Environment configuration template

### 4. **Type Safety & Documentation**
- Added type hints throughout with custom types in `core/types.py`
- Created dataclasses for structured data
- Comprehensive docstrings

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- Pydantic-based settings with environment variable support
- Centralized model configurations
- Easy to extend and modify

### 6. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Proper test structure with `pytest`
- Fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Unit and integration test directories

### 7. **CLI Tools**
- Professional CLI with Click and Rich
- Organized commands for servers, models, and analysis
- Easy-to-use interface

### 8. **Development Experience**
- One-command setup: `make install-dev`
- Easy server startup: `make serve-nn`
- Automated formatting: `make format`
- Comprehensive help: `make help`

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes it easy to find and modify code
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new models or features
3. **Testability**: All components designed for testing
4. **Professionalism**: Follows Python community standards
5. **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and automation

## Next Steps

1. Run `./migrate_structure.sh` to organize existing files
2. Install in development mode: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. Run tests: `make test`
4. Start using the new CLI: `inbox-sentinel --help`

The codebase is now ready for professional development and deployment!
